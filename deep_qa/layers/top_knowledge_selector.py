        This is a method I added in order to allow for proper mask computation in TimeDistributed.
        It is called by TimeDistributedWithMask.compute_mask() - see that code for some more
        insight as to why this is necessary.

        Once we're confident that this works, I plan on submitting a pull request to Keras with our
        improved TimeDistributed class.
