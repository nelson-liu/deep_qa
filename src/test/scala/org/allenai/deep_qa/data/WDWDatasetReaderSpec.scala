    "approach to the environment and health care. \"I think across the board, on stem " +
    "cell research, on a number of areas, you see the Bush administration, even today, moving " +
    "aggressively to do things that I think are probably not in the interest of the " +
    "country,\" John Podesta told Fox. \"We're looking at -- again, in virtually every agency " +
    "to see where we can move forward, whether that's on energy transformation, on improving " +
    "health care, on stem cell research,\" he said. Podesta, who also served as White House " +
    "chief of staff under president Bill Clinton, said he would not \"preview decisions that " +
    "he (Obama) has yet to make.\" However he pointed out that \"as a candidate, Senator " +
    "Obama said that he wanted all the Bush executive orders reviewed, and decide which ones " +
    "should be kept, and which ones should be repealed, and which ones should be " +
    "amended.\" Among the measures that Podesta raised were the Bush administration's move " +
    "to authorize oil and gas drilling in the western state of Utah, and embryonic stem cell " +
    "research which Bush has limited because he views it as destruction of human life. \"They " +
    "want to have oil and gas drilling in some of the most sensitive, fragile lands in Utah that " +
    "they're going to try to do right as they -- walking out the door. I think that's a " +
    "mistake,\" he said. Podesta signaled that Obama would look to take swift action once he " +
    "takes power on January 20. \"There's a lot that the president can do using his executive " +
    "authority without waiting for congressional action, and I think we'll see the president do " +
    "that to try to restore the -- a sense that the country is working on behalf of the common " +
    "good,\" he said. \"We're going to try to restore wages, give people the right kind of " +
    "ways that they can build on their own lives, and when they work hard that they'll be " +
    "rewarded for it,\" he added. Obama is scheduled to visit the White House Monday for talks " +
    "with Bush on the transition."
