class Overlap(Layer):
    """
    This Layer takes 2 inputs: a ``tensor_a`` (e.g. a document) and a ``tensor_b``
    (e.g. a question). It returns a one-hot vector suitable for feature
    representation with the same shape as ``tensor_a``,
    indicating at each index whether the element in ``tensor_a`` appears in
    ``tensor_b``. Note that the output is not the same shape as ``tensor_a``.

    Inputs:
        - tensor_a: shape ``(batch_size, length_a)``
        - tensor_b shape ``(batch_size, length_b)``

    Output:
        - Collection of one-hot vectors indicating
          overlap: shape ``(batch_size, length_a, 2)``
