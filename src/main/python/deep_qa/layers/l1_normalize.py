    '''
    This Layer normalizes a tensor by its L1 norm.  This could just be a `Lambda` layer that calls our
    `tensors.l1_normalize` function, except that `Lambda` layers do not properly handle masked
    input.
    The expected input to this layer is a tensor of shape `(batch_size, num_options)`, with a mask
    of the same shape.  We also accept an input tensor of shape `(batch_size, num_options, 1)`,
    which we will squeeze to be `(batch_size, num_options)` (though the mask must still be
    `(batch_size, num_options)`).
    We give no output mask, as we expect this to only be used at the end of the model, to get a
    final probability distribution over class labels.  If you need this to propagate the mask for
    your model, it would be pretty easy to change it to optionally do so - submit a PR.
