class WeightedSum(Layer):
    '''
    This Layer takes a matrix of vectors and a vector of row weights, and returns a weighted sum
    of the vectors.  You might use this to get some aggregate sentence representation after
    computing an attention over the sentence, for example.

    Input shapes:
        matrix: (batch_size, num_rows, embedding_dim), with mask (batch_size, num_rows)
        vector: (batch_size, num_rows), mask is ignored
    Output shape: (batch_size, embedding_dim)

    A usage note: you probably should have used a mask when you computed your attention weights, so
    any row that's masked in the matrix _should_ already be 0 in the attention vector.  But just in
    case you didn't, we'll handle a mask on the matrix here too.

    While the above spec shows inputs with 3 and 2 modes, we also allow inputs of any order; we
    always sum over the second-to-last dimension of the "matrix", weighted by the last dimension of
    the "vector".  Higher-order tensors get complicated for matching things, though, so there is a
    hard constraint: all dimensions in the "matrix" before the final embedding must be matched in
    the "vector".

    For example, say I have a "matrix" with dimensions (batch_size, num_queries, num_words,
    embedding_dim), representing some kind of embedding or encoding of several multi-word queries.
    My attention "vector" must then have at least those dimensions, and could have more.  So I
    could have an attention over words per query, with shape (batch_size, num_queries, num_words),
    or I could have an attention over query words for every document in some list, with shape
    (batch_size, num_documents, num_queries, num_words).  Both of these cases are fine.  In the
    first case, the returned tensor will have shape (batch_size, num_queries, embedding_dim), and
    in the second case, it will have shape (batch_size, num_documents, num_queries, embedding_dim).
    But you _can't_ have an attention "vector" that does not include all of the queries, so shape
    (batch_size, num_words) is not allowed - you haven't specified how to handle that dimension in
    the "matrix", so we can't do anything with this input.
